Description: educational programming environment
 KTurtle is an educational programming environment which uses the TurtleScript
 programming language (inspired by Logo) to make programming as easy and
 accessible as possible.
 .
 The user issues TurtleScript language commands to control the "turtle", which
 draws on the canvas, making KTurtle suitable for teaching elementary
 mathematics, geometry and programming.
 .
 This package is part of the KDE education module.
